Performace is all about partitions
Partitions--Reads/Writes are dependent on partitions

Two Formula's
one based on Performance
No of Partitions = Desired RCU/3000 RCU + Desired WCU/1000 WCU

one based on Capacity
No of Partitions = Data Size in GB/10 GB 


Select an Appropriate Partition Key
---Should have many distinct values
---Uniform write pattern across all partition key values
---You shouldn't mix hot & cold key values within a table

If there is hotspotting of Keys on one specific partition, use Prefixing or Suffixing of the partition key for better performance.

If too many writes(Uneven Writes) on Main table and GSI, use SQS as a managed Buffer.
Sensors ----> SQL Queue -----> Lambda -----> DynamoDB

Uneven Reads(Promotion Products on an ecommerce site)
Use caching(Inmemory cache)
Also we can use DynamoDb Streams
