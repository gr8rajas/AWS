Performace is all about partitions
Partitions--Reads/Writes are dependent on partitions

Two Formula's
one based on Performance
No of Partitions = Desired RCU/3000 RCU + Desired WCU/1000 WCU

one based on Capacity
No of Partitions = Data Size in GB/10 GB 


Select an Appropriate Partition Key
---Should have many distinct values
---Uniform write pattern across all partition key values
---You shouldn't mix hot & cold key values within a table

If there is hotspotting of Keys on one specific partition, use Prefixing or Suffixing of the partition key for better performance.
