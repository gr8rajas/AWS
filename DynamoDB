DyanamoDB supports both Document and Key Value Store DB service
Fully resilient and highly available
Data is accessed by HTTP endpoints

DyanomoDB is a collection of tables in a Region(availability zone is unimportant in DynamoDb architecture)

Perforamce units(read,write capacity in 1 WCU=1KB per write, 1 RCU =4KB per write)

Eventual consistent reads(Default)--(Use 1/2 RCU)--less cost
Strongly consistent reads(use 1 RCU)

All rows in a DynamoDB table is referred as items(Collection of attributes)
Table partition Key(Hash Key) -- uniquely identify an item
Sort Key/Range Key --(Allows one to many relationships and Sorting Order Ex:Reading of Temperature)

Data types
---Scalar Types(String, number, Binary, Boolean)
---DynamoDB types(Document(List/Map), Set--An Array Datatype)

One partition can store 10 GB of data in 1 Node and can handle 3000 RCU and 1000 WCU
Data is distributed based on its partition Key(Hash Key)
The number of Partitions is managed by DyanamoDB and grow automatically
No Automatic decrease of partitions in DynamoDB

DynamoDB offers two retrieval operations--SCAN(Inefficeint) & QUERY



Indexes come in two forms --- Global Secondary and Local Secondary

Local Secondary Indexes can be created only at Table Creation
Local Secondary Indexes used an alternative Sort Key (By default contains hash key,sort key and new sort key) and any other 
attributes can be added as Projected Values
Any data written to the main table is copied asynchronously to LSI's(Eventaul consistencty)
Writing data to LSI's consume RCU's and WCU's
LSI is a Sparse Index.

Be default any non key values are not stored in an LSI

Take care with planning your LSI and item Projections----** Its important **

LSI Storage concerns
----Be aware of ItemCollections(Storing in Main table and LSI)
The maximum size of an Item collection is 10GB


Global Secondary Indexes has same concept of LSI's but they have an alternate Partition & Sort Key
Number of options for attribute projections:
KEYS_ONLY -- New Partition and Sort Keys, old Partition Key if applicable, old Sort Key
INCLUDE --- specify custom Projection Values
ALL --- All attributes into GSI
Any data written to the main table is copied asynchronously to GSI's(Eventaul consistencty)



DynamoDB Stream:
An ordered Record of updates to a DynamoDb table
When a stream is enabled on table using API, it records changes to a table and store it for 24 hours
Streams Endpoint is different from DynamoDB endpoint to access

Streams Configurations:
KEYS_ONLY -- Only the Key attributes are written to Stream
NEW_IMAGE -- Enter item POST Update is written to Stream
OLD_IMAGE -- Enter item PRE Update is written to Stream
NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGE -- the pre and post comparison without consulting DynamoDB

Use Cases:
Replication(DR failure)
Triggers(Lamba)
