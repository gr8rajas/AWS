Multiclass Classification Model
--A classification task with more than two classes; 
e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples, or pears.

Binary classification Model
--Ex: Will Customer buy a product or not? Is the transaction fradu or not?(Yes or No)

When we need to check or visualize the performance of the multi - class classification problem, 
we use AUC (Area Under The Curve) ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve. 
It is one of the most important evaluation metrics for checking any classification modelâ€™s performance.
It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s.
By analogy, Higher the AUC, better the model is at distinguishing between patients with disease and no disease.
Ranges from 0 and 1

Regression Model
--Ex: To determine your home worth, Predict a numeric value

RMSE(Root Mean Square Error)---to determine quality of Model
---The Lower the RMSE, the better the model Performance
