Fast and fully Managed
Never Use it fot OLTP applications
ANS-SQL compatible
Its a column Oriented Database
Redshift is a Single Availibility zone concept

Can connect to Redshift Cluster using Redashift Endpoint

Backups to S3 done in parallel
"Shared Nothing" architecture


To copy data from S3 to Redshift
----> use copy command.  copy 'table' from 's3 bucket' credentails 'iam-role'

Columnar Database is not ideal for small amount of data(100 Gb or less)
Not ideal for large Binary Objects


Table Design:

----> distribution Styles
Even -- Rows are distributed across slices regarding the values in a particular column(Default distribution)
     -- No joins, reduced parallelism
Key -- data is collocated
    -- Tables used in joins
    -- Large fact tables in a Star Schema
All - entire distribution is stored in each node
    -- Data not changig frequently
    -- Data is few million Rows
    -- No common distribution Key
