Fast and fully Managed
Never Use it fot OLTP applications
ANS-SQL compatible
Its a column Oriented Database
Redshift is a Single Availibility zone concept

Can connect to Redshift Cluster using Redashift Endpoint

Backups to S3 done in parallel
"Shared Nothing" architecture


To copy data from S3 to Redshift
----> use copy command.  copy 'table' from 's3 bucket' credentails 'iam-role'

Columnar Database is not ideal for small amount of data(100 Gb or less)
Not ideal for large Binary Objects


Table Design:

----> distribution Styles
Even -- Rows are distributed across slices regarding the values in a particular column(Default distribution)
     -- No joins, reduced parallelism
Key -- data is collocated
    -- Tables used in joins
    -- Large fact tables in a Star Schema
All - entire distribution is stored in each node
    -- Data not changig frequently
    -- Data is few million Rows
    -- No common distribution Key


Redshift Sort Keys:
     Redshift stores your data on disk according to sorted order.
     Sort Keys are closest thing to index.
     Redshift blocksize 1MB
     
Use Timestamp column as Sort Keys
Column that are involved in Join conditions(Same column for Distributed nad Sort)
     
Compound SortKey -- Includes all the Columns listed in the Sort Key Definition(Default)
                     Benefits Joins,Order By,Group By, Partition By,Order By window functions
                     Run Vaccum(Resort) and Analyze operations on large data loads
Interleaved SortKey -- Equal Weight to each column in the sort key
                     -- Multiple queries/diferent filters(BI)
                     --  Run Vaccum(Resort) and Analyze operations on large data loads is slower
                     -- Use on large data loads(100 Million + rows)
                     -- Not good for data being loaded in Sorted order

Compression Technique:
Use Automatic Compression(Recommended)
Can also specify in DDL
copy command(compupdate off) -- Analyze compression table;

Constraints in Redshift:
PRIMARY KEY  -- Not Enforced
FOREIGN KEY  -- Not Enforced
UNIQUE       -- Not Enforced
NULL/NOT NULL  --- -Enforced
REFERENCES(PK referring to FK in a diff table)  -- Not Enforced
