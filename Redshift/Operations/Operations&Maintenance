Vaccum:(Blocks are immutable)
Vaccum helps to recover the space and sorts the table
Vaccum after bulk loads,updates and deletes

VACCUM FULL 'TABLE_NAME';
VACCUM SORT ONLY 'TABLE_NAME';(No reclaiming disk space, Only sort)
VACCUM DELETE ONLY 'TABLE_NAME';(Reclaims disk space, No sort)
VACCUM REINDEX 'TABLE_NAME';(Use for interkeaved sort keys)

Use deepcopy on very large tables(Vaccum can be slow on large tables - 700GB)
--recreates and repopulate with bulk insert, including sorting.
