An EMR cluster can have at most 50 Instance groups(Collection of Ec2 Instances)
1 Master Instance Group. ---> 1 or more Core Instance Group. -----> 48 Task Instance groups

EMR is a Single Availability Zone concept.(because of replication-latency)

Master Node ----> Core Nodes(HDFS)------> Task Nodes -optional(only for Procesing Ex: executors extra capacity, No HDFS)

Storage Options:
Instance Store--local storage directly attached to Ec2 (Ephemeral-del)
              -- High IOPS at low cost
              (D2 and I3)
EBS Volumes --Volumes do not persist after Cluster termination
EMR File System --Stores data on S3
                --Uses data directly on S3 without ingesting into HDFS
                --take advantage of reliability, durability and scalability of S3
                --resize & terminate EMR clusters without losing data
                -- Use EMRFS and HDFS together for high I/O performance
EMRFS and Consistent View
                -- Checks for list and read-after-write consistency for new S3 objects written on synched with EMRFS
                 (Uses DynamoDb in background for track of S3 objects)
