An EMR cluster can have at most 50 Instance groups(Collection of Ec2 Instances)
1 Master Instance Group. ---> 1 or more Core Instance Group. -----> 48 Task Instance groups

EMR is a Single Availability Zone concept.(because of replication-latency)

Master Node ----> Core Nodes(HDFS)------> Task Nodes -optional(only for Procesing Ex: executors extra capacity, No HDFS)

Storage Options:
Instance Store--local storage directly attached to Ec2 (Ephemeral-del)
              -- High IOPS at low cost
              (D2 and I3)
EBS Volumes --Volumes do not persist after Cluster termination
EMR File System --Stores data on S3
                --Uses data directly on S3 without ingesting into HDFS
                --take advantage of reliability, durability and scalability of S3
                --resize & terminate EMR clusters without losing data
                -- Use EMRFS and HDFS together for high I/O performance
EMRFS and Consistent View
                -- Checks for list and read-after-write consistency for new S3 objects written on synched with EMRFS
                 (Uses DynamoDb in background for track of S3 objects)


Choosing the appropriate Instance Type
MapReduce -- M3 or M4 Instance
Machine Learning -- P2 or C3 or C4 Instance
Spark -- R3 or R4 Instance types
Large HBase/Large Instance Stored HBase(I/O performace and IOPS) --D2/I2 or I3



Master Node Sizing
Clusters with 50 Nodes or less(Use m3.xlarge or m4.xlarge for your Master Node)
Clusters with 50 Nodes or more (Use m3.2xlarge or m4.2xlarge for your Master Node)

Core Node Sizing

Use HDFS Cluster if high I/O is required else EMR cluster

Replication factor of EMR, by default..
Cluster of 10 Nodes or more -- 3
Cluster of 4-9 Nodes        -- 2
Cluster of 3 Nodes or less. -- 1
